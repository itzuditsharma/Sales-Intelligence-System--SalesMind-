Priya (Sales Lead) Thanks everyone for joining. Let’s start with the updates from the enterprise accounts.
 
Ravi (Account Manager) Sure. So, NovaHealth Systems had a great follow-up call yesterday. They’re interested in moving to the next stage of the proposal review, and we’re finalizing the pricing details by Friday.
 
Priya Perfect. That sounds like an active one — let’s make sure the legal team is looped in.
 
Ravi Yes, already done. Also, I spoke with Ventron earlier this week. They’re reviewing the integration plan and have asked for a proof-of-concept demo next Tuesday.
 
Priya Nice. That’s progressing well. What about Xeron.

Ravi this is over budget.

Priya, I think this is not a feasible solution.
