2025-7-09 14:01 – Deepak Yadav: Salesforce quoted ₹5.6 Lakhs with SLA and migration support. Freshdesk came in at ₹5.0 Lakhs.  
2025-7-09 14:02 – Tanya Singh: Freshworks proposal is ₹5.3 Lakhs including AI-driven analytics and onboarding.  
2025-7-09 14:03 – Deepak Yadav: Budget is tight; finance leans toward Freshdesk.  
2025-7-09 14:04 – Tanya Singh: I can match Freshdesk’s price and add 1 extra month of support.  
2025-7-09 14:05 – Deepak Yadav: That helps, but Salesforce offers integration with existing ERP systems.  
2025-7-09 14:06 – Tanya Singh: I’ll provide integration support and highlight cost benefits.  
2025-7-09 14:07 – Deepak Yadav: Leadership will review; your proposal is competitive.  
2025-7-09 14:08 – Tanya Singh: Great. I’ll send updated proposal by EOD.  
2025-7-09 14:09 – Deepak Yadav: Thanks, Tanya. Will confirm after internal discussion.
