2025-4-12 15:10 – Sahaj Mehta: Neel, NovaHealth Systems reviewed our cloud automation vs HubSpot. Feedback?  
2025-4-12 15:11 – Neel Kapoor: HubSpot quoted ₹6.0 Lakhs, including SLA monitoring and multi-channel integration.  
2025-4-12 15:12 – Sahaj Mehta: Our Freshworks suite is ₹6.5 Lakhs but with AI predictions and SLA alerts.  
2025-4-12 15:13 – Neel Kapoor: Finance notes the difference; they prefer HubSpot’s lower cost.  
2025-4-12 15:14 – Sahaj Mehta: If I reduce to ₹6.1 Lakhs and add 2 months free support, would it help?  
2025-4-12 15:15 – Neel Kapoor: Closer, but HubSpot also offers onboarding and dashboards.  
2025-4-12 15:16 – Sahaj Mehta: I can match dashboards and include dedicated support for 1 month.  
2025-4-12 15:17 – Neel Kapoor: Leadership still evaluating, but this strengthens our case.  
2025-4-12 15:18 – Sahaj Mehta: Good. I’ll send the updated proposal today.  
2025-4-12 15:19 – Neel Kapoor: Thanks, Sahaj. Will confirm after finance discussion.
