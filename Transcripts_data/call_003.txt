2025-3-05 10:02 – Naman Gupta: Hi Tarini, your team compared our Freshworks suite with HubSpot, right?  
2025-3-05 10:03 – Tarini Rao: Yes, Naman. HubSpot quoted ₹4.6 Lakhs annually, including campaign tracking and lead scoring.  
2025-3-05 10:04 – Naman Gupta: Our Freshworks proposal was ₹5.2 Lakhs with AI insights and WhatsApp integration.  
2025-3-05 10:05 – Tarini Rao: Finance favors HubSpot due to lower cost. Freshdesk was also evaluated for support automation.  
2025-3-05 10:06 – Naman Gupta: I can reduce to ₹4.9 Lakhs and include 2 months of onboarding.  
2025-3-05 10:07 – Tarini Rao: That’s closer, but HubSpot offers free dashboard customization. Salesforce is a possible alternative next quarter.  
2025-3-05 10:08 – Naman Gupta: I can match pricing, add 1 month extra support, and ensure Salesforce compatibility.  
2025-3-05 10:09 – Tarini Rao: Sounds reasonable. I’ll present this to leadership.  
2025-3-05 10:10 – Naman Gupta: Great. Sending revised quote today.  
2025-3-05 10:11 – Tarini Rao: Perfect. Will update once internal review concludes.  
2025-3-05 10:12 – Naman Gupta: Thanks, Tarini. Hoping for a positive decision.
